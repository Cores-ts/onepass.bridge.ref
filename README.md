# OnePass Bridge flows


## Startup Enrollment flow

The startup enrollment journey consists of seven flows, which are grouped into three main categories: Onboarding, Verification, and Workspace Setup. As the OnePass Bridge pilot is accessible only through invitation, an optional flow is provided for users to request an invitation by completing a form. This particular flow is not covered here.

### Onboarding
- Sign in/Sign up
- Create a company profile

### Verification
- Elegibility check
- User verification
- Business verification

### Workspace setup
